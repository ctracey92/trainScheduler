* About
A train schedulng app. The user inputs the train name, destination, firts arrival time, and how often it runs. Based on the user input the application will calculate the number of minutes until the next train arrival, and what time it will arrive at. The input, and calculated variables will be stored in firebase so that it will be loaded on every use of the page. 

* Objective
    - The main point of this objective is to demonstrate the mastery of Firebase storage, dynamically displaying the stored results to the page, and utilizing Moment.Js to run the calculations of the train scheduler. 

* Approach
    - The first major step to achieving this was to create the form to capture user input (with light form validation), and save the results to Firebase.
    - The second major step was to call that saved data and display it on the page in a readable format.
    - The third and final major step was to integrate Moment.Js to provide the time calculations needed to display when the next train will be/how many minutes until the next one.
